#  PONG ALONE 🏓

A simple, accelerometer-controlled paddle game built with Jetpack Compose. This was created as a project for an Android development course.

## 🎮 Gameplay

This is a variation of the classic Pong game. Two paddles, one at the top and one at the bottom of the screen, are controlled simultaneously by tilting the device. The objective is to keep the ball bouncing between the paddles for as long as possible.

-   **Tilt your device** 📱 left and right to move the paddles.
-   Each time the ball hits a paddle, your **score increases**, and the ball's speed increases slightly.
-   The game ends if the ball goes past either paddle.

## ✨ Features

-   **Motion Controls:** Utilizes the device's accelerometer for intuitive paddle movement.
-   **Dynamic Difficulty:** The ball speeds up after each successful hit, increasing the challenge.
-   **Retro Feel:** Features a classic, minimalist design with a retro-style font.
-   **Built with Modern Android Tech:** Developed entirely in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose.

## 🚀 Building and Running

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Let Gradle sync and download dependencies.
4.  Run the app on an Android device with an accelerometer.

## 💻 Development

This project serves as a practical example of using Jetpack Compose for game development and integrating hardware sensors like the accelerometer.
